These are the experiments for the manuscript: Rotation-Equivariant Semantic Instance Segmentation

So far, only the experiments for the scattered sticks dataset is uploaded. The experiments for the BBBC038 dataset is coming soon, but without the data due to lack of space on github.

To run the code:

1. upload the .ipynb files to google colab: https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index. You need a google account to be able to do this.
2. Note that the code only works for python3. Google colab currently only supports python3.
3. Make sure your environment is properly configured. To configure the environment, click 'run', then select 'change runtime type'. Under 'Runtime type', select 'python3'. Under 'Hardware acceleration', select 'GPU'. Under 'Runtime shape' select 'High RAM'. You might need to sign up for colab pro to be able to run in a high RAM environment. 
4. Open the file and press ctrl + f9 to run all the cells in order.
5. Optional. If the above setup does not work, you should be able to setup a local environment using the .py file instead. Note the libraries that are imported in the notebook, and install them using e.g. pip.
