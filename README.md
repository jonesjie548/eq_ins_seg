These are the experiments for the manuscript: Rotation-Equivariant Semantic Instance Segmentation

To run the code:

1. upload the .ipynb files to google colab: https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index. You need a google account to be able to do this.
2. Make sure your environment is properly configured. To configure the environmnent, click 'run', then select 'change runtime type'. Under 'Runtime type', select 'python3'. Under 'Hardware acceleration', select 'GPU'. Under 'Runtime shape' select 'High RAM'. You might need to sing upp for colab pro to be able to run in a high RAM environment. 
3. Open the file and click ctrl + f9 to run all the cells in order.
4. Optional. If the above setup does not work, you should be able to setup a local environment using the .py file instead. Note the libraries that are imported in the notebook, and install them using e.g. pip.
